About 
=====

Here is my vim configuration. It is inspired by that of [ornicar] [ornicar]
which is primarily responsible for my fall into the cult of vim users.

Installation 
============

Clone the repository:

    $ clone git://github.com/docteurklein/dot-files.git  dot_files
    $ ln -s dot_files .vim

Create a symbolic link of the .vimrc file into your home directory:

    $ ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc

Done!
